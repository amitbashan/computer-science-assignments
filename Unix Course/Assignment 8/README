Q1 is not all correct. I know.

Those questions we're not explained properly and
whoever wrote the assignment did a poor job.

Some things aren't perfect; for example in `Q1/P8.2`
the output is not filtered properly just because I can't
handle this assignment anymore. It's more than exhausting
to prototype in Bash.

This assignment was a total nightmare.
